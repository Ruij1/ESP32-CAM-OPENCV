# ESP32-CAM + OpenCV Project

## Overview
Collaborative IoT project focused on integrating the ESP32-CAM module with OpenCV to capture images and perform basic computer vision processing. The project explores how low-cost embedded hardware can be combined with computer vision techniques for practical experimentation.

## Problem
The objective was to understand how an embedded device with limited resources can:
- Capture images reliably
- Transmit image data to a processing environment
- Apply basic computer vision techniques for analysis and experimentation

This project was designed as a hands-on approach to learning IoT and computer vision fundamentals.

## Solution
A system where the ESP32-CAM captures images and sends them to a processing pipeline where OpenCV is used to perform image processing tasks such as visualization and basic analysis.

The solution demonstrates the interaction between hardware, networking, and software processing.

## Collaboration
This project was developed collaboratively by:
- **Rui Hermosillo**
- **Kimberly Alcala**

Both contributors participated in the design, development, and testing of the solution.
